# payment-starter-kit

Simple starter kit for setting up Connext

## How to use this kit

The `master` branch contains a ready-to-go demo of the starter kit:

1. Kernel deployment script `./kernel/deploy.prod.sh`
2. Basic UI components for sending and receiving micropayments through your Hub.
3. The Connext contracts `./contracts/`
4. A connext-client that is already integrated into the UI

To fire up this branch, check out _Starting the Demo_ below.

The `tutorial` branch contains a stripped down version of the demo so that you can follow along with our [Integrating the Connext Client] tutorial.
